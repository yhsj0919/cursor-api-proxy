# cursor-api-proxy

OpenAI-compatible proxy for Cursor CLI. Run it on localhost and point any LLM client (OpenAI SDK, LiteLLM, LangChain, etc.) at it like a normal chat API.

Windows 中文说明：[docs/WINDOWS-中文使用指南.md](docs/WINDOWS-中文使用指南.md)

One npm package, two uses: import it as an SDK, or run the CLI to start the server. Same behavior either way.

This is not the Cursor IDE. The HTTP API will not attach your repo, `@codebase`, or host shell the way the desktop app does. See [Local workspace and agent frameworks](#local-workspace-and-agent-frameworks).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Cursor agent CLI (`cursor-agent` or `agent`). This package does not install or bundle the CLI. Install and set it up separately. The proxy prefers `cursor-agent` on `PATH`, then falls back to `agent`. Set `CURSOR_AGENT_BIN` when another vendor also installs an `agent` command.

  ```bash
  curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash
  agent login
  agent --list-models
  ```

  For automation, set `CURSOR_API_KEY` instead of using `agent login`.

## Install

From npm (SDK in another project):

```bash
npm install cursor-api-proxy
```

From source:

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd cursor-api-proxy
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run the proxy (CLI)

Start the server so the API is available for the SDK or any HTTP client:

```bash
npx cursor-api-proxy
# or from repo: npm start / node dist/cli.js
```

Inspect completed requests without opening the dashboard:

```bash
cursor-api-proxy requests
cursor-api-proxy requests --limit 50
cursor-api-proxy requests --watch --interval 1
```

The command reads `CURSOR_BRIDGE_SESSIONS_LOG` (default
`~/.cursor-api-proxy/sessions.log`) directly, so the proxy does not need to be
running. It shows completion time, method, status, remote address, and path.
Set `NO_COLOR=1` for plain output.

To expose on your network (e.g. Tailscale):

```bash
npx cursor-api-proxy --tailscale
```

By default the server listens on http://127.0.0.1:8765. Set `CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY` to require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on requests.

### HTTPS with Tailscale (MagicDNS)

Serve over HTTPS so browsers and clients trust the connection (e.g. `https://macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net:8765`):

1. Generate Tailscale certificates on this machine (run from the project directory or where you want the cert files):

   ```bash
   sudo tailscale cert macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net
   ```

   This creates `macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.crt` and `macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.key` in the current directory.

2. Run the proxy with TLS and optional Tailscale bind:

   ```bash
   export CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY=your-secret
   export CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_CERT=/path/to/macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.crt
   export CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_KEY=/path/to/macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.key
   # Bind to Tailscale IP so the service is only on the tailnet (optional):
   export CURSOR_BRIDGE_HOST=100.123.47.103
   npm start
   ```

   Or bind to all interfaces and use HTTPS:

   ```bash
   CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_CERT=./macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.crt \
   CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_KEY=./macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net.key \
   CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY=your-secret \
   npm start -- --tailscale
   ```

3. Access the API from any device on your tailnet:
   - Base URL: `https://macbook.tail4048eb.ts.net:8765/v1` (use your MagicDNS name and port)
   - Browsers show a padlock with no certificate warnings when using Tailscale-issued certs.

## Local workspace and agent frameworks

Point OpenClaw, LangChain, or your own agent runtime at this proxy with a normal `baseUrl` and `apiKey`, and you get a cloud model behind an OpenAI-shaped HTTP API. That is not the Cursor IDE, which indexes and acts on a local workspace.

The model only sees what you send: `messages`, optional tool schemas, and tool results your client executes and returns. No automatic filesystem, repo layout, or `@codebase` injection from the proxy alone. By default the proxy also prepends a short bridge context block (see `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_PREAMBLE`) so the model knows the request came through this HTTP bridge and which workspace paths apply.

File reads, shell commands, and directory listings only happen when your agent framework implements tools, runs them on the host, and sends outputs back in follow-up messages. The proxy does not do that for you.

Optional server-side workspace: the Cursor CLI may run with a workspace directory (`CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE`, per-request `X-Cursor-Workspace`). By default, `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CHAT_ONLY_WORKSPACE=true` runs the CLI in an empty temp directory so it does not read or write your real project. The proxy also overrides `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, and `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` so the agent does not load global or project rules from elsewhere. Set it to `false` if you want the CLI to see a path on the machine where the proxy runs. That is still not IDE indexing. See the env table below.

For agents that need local context: use client-side tools (`read_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`) and pass results as tool messages; add RAG or retrieval and inject snippets into `user` content; or paste relevant files into the prompt. There is no built-in way to sync an entire workspace through the proxy today.

### Client tool passthrough (ACP)

Set `CURSOR_BRIDGE_USE_ACP=true` to receive structured client tool calls. Tool-bearing requests require a Cursor ACP build that advertises HTTP MCP support. The proxy supports:

- Chat Completions `tools` / legacy `functions` → `message.tool_calls`; resume with `role: "tool"` and `tool_call_id`.
- Responses flat function tools → `function_call` output items; resume with `previous_response_id` and `function_call_output`.
- Anthropic tools with `input_schema` → `tool_use`; resume with `tool_result`.
- Sync and streaming output, mixed text plus tools, parallel calls, multiple rounds, named/required/none choices.

The proxy exposes each request's schemas through a random, bearer-authenticated MCP URL bound only to `127.0.0.1`. It never executes caller tools. It parks Cursor's MCP call, returns the native API tool call to your framework, then delivers your framework's result back to the same live ACP turn. Proxy-owned MCP permission is allowed once; built-in and other tool permissions remain rejected.

Tool loops are stateful and in-process:

- Keep the same proxy process alive between the call and its result.
- Submit results before `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS`. Expiration, restart, unknown IDs, or wrong API-key owner return HTTP `409`.
- Parallel results may arrive together or incrementally. The original account/profile and temporary workspace stay attached until the turn finishes.
- A client disconnect while a turn is active cancels the ACP child and removes temporary state.
- Responses API objects remain externally `completed` while an internal ACP turn waits for `function_call_output`.

Minimal Chat Completions loop:

```js
const messages = [{ role: "user", content: "Weather in Paris?" }];
const tools = [{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "weather",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { city: { type: "string" } },
      required: ["city"],
    },
  },
}];

const first = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "auto",
  messages,
  tools,
});
const assistant = first.choices[0].message;
messages.push(assistant);
for (const call of assistant.tool_calls ?? []) {
  const args = JSON.parse(call.function.arguments);
  const output = await getWeather(args.city); // executed by your app
  messages.push({ role: "tool", tool_call_id: call.id, content: output });
}
const final = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: "auto", messages });
```

## Use as SDK in another project

Install the package and set up the Cursor agent CLI (see Prerequisites). With the default URL, the proxy starts in the background automatically if it is not already running. You can still start it yourself with `npx cursor-api-proxy` or set `CURSOR_PROXY_URL` to point at an existing proxy (then the SDK will not start another).

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1` (override with `CURSOR_PROXY_URL` or options).
- API key: use any value (e.g. `unused`), or set `CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY` and pass it in options or env.
- Disable auto-start: pass `startProxy: false` (or use a custom `baseUrl`) if you run the proxy yourself and don't want the SDK to start it.
- Shutdown: when the SDK starts the proxy, it stops it on process exit or normal termination signals. `stopManagedProxy()` is still available for earlier shutdown. `SIGKILL` cannot be intercepted.

### OpenAI SDK + helper

Optional consumer-side example. `openai` is not a dependency of `cursor-api-proxy`; install it only in the app where you run this.

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { getOpenAIOptionsAsync } from "cursor-api-proxy";

const opts = await getOpenAIOptionsAsync(); // starts proxy if needed
const client = new OpenAI(opts);

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-5.2",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});
console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5.2",
  input: "Hello",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

For a sync config without auto-start, use `getOpenAIOptions()` and ensure the proxy is already running.

### Minimal client (no OpenAI SDK)

```js
import { createCursorProxyClient } from "cursor-api-proxy";

const proxy = createCursorProxyClient(); // proxy starts on first request if needed
const data = await proxy.chatCompletionsCreate({
  model: "auto",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});
console.log(data.choices?.[0]?.message?.content);
```

### Raw OpenAI client (no SDK import from this package)

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY || "unused",
});
// Start the proxy yourself (npx cursor-api-proxy) or use the helpers above for auto-start.
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path                   | Description                                                           |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`              | Server and config info                                                |
| GET    | `/v1/models`           | List Cursor models (from `agent --list-models`)                       |
| POST   | `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat + native `tool_calls`; supports `stream: true`                    |
| POST   | `/v1/responses`        | Responses text + `function_call`; supports semantic SSE streaming     |
| POST   | `/v1/messages`         | Anthropic Messages + `tool_use`; supports `stream: true`              |

### Reasoning effort

OpenAI clients can select a Cursor reasoning variant without hard-coding its
full Cursor model ID:

- Chat Completions: `reasoning_effort`
- Responses: `reasoning.effort`

For example, model `gpt-5.6-sol` with effort `high` resolves to
`gpt-5.6-sol-high` when that ID is present in the live `agent --list-models`
catalog. Explicit variants can be retargeted, and `-fast` is preserved
(`gpt-5.6-sol-high-fast` plus `low` resolves to
`gpt-5.6-sol-low-fast`). Supported spellings are `none`/`off`, `minimal`,
`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`/`extra-high`, and `max`. The API returns
`400 unsupported_reasoning_effort` instead of silently choosing another model
when the requested family does not offer that level.

Usage and token fields: responses may include `usage` token fields (`prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens` for Chat Completions, `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` for Responses). These are heuristic estimates (character count ÷ 4), not Cursor billing meters. Do not use them for invoicing.

### Codex custom provider

Codex uses Responses API custom tools for its shell and patch operations. Enable
ACP so the proxy can pass those tool calls back to Codex:

```powershell
$env:CURSOR_BRIDGE_USE_ACP = "true"
npm start
```

Then register the local proxy in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_provider = "cursor"
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"

[model_providers.cursor]
name = "Cursor API Proxy"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = false
```

The Responses adapter supports both `function` and raw-input `custom` tools,
including streaming `custom_tool_call` events and stateless `store=false`
continuations correlated by `call_id`.

## Environment variables

One module resolves aliases, defaults, path resolution, platform fallbacks, and `--tailscale` host behavior before the server starts.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8765` | Port |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_API_KEY` | — | If set, require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on requests |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` / `CURSOR_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Cursor access token passed to spawned CLI/ACP children (automation, headless). Same value can be used for both names. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE` | process cwd | Base workspace directory for Cursor CLI. With `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CHAT_ONLY_WORKSPACE=false`, header `X-Cursor-Workspace` must point to an existing directory under this path (after resolving real paths). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_MODE` | — | Server default for Cursor CLI `--mode`: `agent`, `ask`, or `plan`. If unset, default is `ask`. Env wins over CLI `--mode` when both are set. Per request, JSON body `mode` or header `X-Cursor-Mode` overrides (precedence: body → header → DSH auto-mode → this env → `--mode` → `ask`). Invalid value → startup error. With `agent` (or `plan`) and real workspace, the CLI may read/write files under `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE` / cwd. See `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CHAT_ONLY_WORKSPACE`. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_DSH_AUTO_MODE` | `false` | When enabled, requests whose system/developer content contains the DSH system marker use Cursor `plan` while the plan marker is present and `agent` otherwise. Ordinary user content is never inspected. Explicit body/header modes still win. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_DSH_SYSTEM_MARKER` | `You are an AI agent powered by DeepSeek Harness.` | Exact substring identifying trusted DSH-owned system/developer content for auto-mode. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_DSH_PLAN_MARKER` | `You are in plan mode.` | Exact substring emitted by DSH while `/plan` is active. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `auto` | Default model when request omits one |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_STRICT_MODEL` | `true` | Reject a requested model when Cursor's CLI/ACP catalogs cannot match it instead of silently selecting the ACP session default. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_FORCE` | `false` | Pass `--force` to Cursor CLI |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_APPROVE_MCPS` | `false` | Pass `--approve-mcps` to Cursor CLI |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | Timeout per completion and idle TTL for a parked client-tool turn (ms). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_CERT` | — | Path to TLS certificate file (e.g. Tailscale cert). Use with `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_KEY` for HTTPS. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_KEY` | — | Path to TLS private key file. Use with `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_CERT` for HTTPS. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_SESSIONS_LOG` | `~/.cursor-api-proxy/sessions.log` | Path to log file; each request is appended as a line (timestamp, method, path, IP, status). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CHAT_ONLY_WORKSPACE` | `true` | When `true` (default), the CLI runs in an empty temp dir so it cannot read or write your project; pure chat only. The proxy also overrides `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, and `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` so the agent cannot load rules from `~/.cursor` or project rules from elsewhere. Set to `false` to pass the real workspace (e.g. for `X-Cursor-Workspace`). Mode interaction: for a request whose effective mode is not `ask`, if this variable was not set in the environment (left at default), the proxy uses the real workspace for that request so `agent` / `plan` can touch files. If you did set this variable in the environment (to `true` or `false`), that choice is always honored for every request. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_PREAMBLE` | `true` | When `true` (default), prepends 1–3 short lines to the agent prompt: one line stating the request went through `cursor-api-proxy` → Cursor CLI, the effective `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE` / agent cwd (deduped when they match), CLI mode, and whether the agent cwd is a temp sandbox; optional `X-Cursor-Workspace=` from that header; optional `client=` from `X-Cursor-Invoke-From` or `X-Cursor-Proxy-Client` only (User-Agent is not echoed); optional `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_EXTRA`. Set to `false` to disable. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_EXTRA` | — | Optional free-text (max 400 characters, NUL stripped) on its own line after the above. Use for a single short fact if needed. Do not put secrets here (tokens, API keys). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_VERBOSE` | `false` | When `true`, print full request messages and response content to stdout for every completion (both stream and sync). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_MAX_MODE` | `false` | When `true`, enable Cursor Max Mode for all requests (larger context window, higher tool-call limits). The proxy writes `maxMode: true` to `cli-config.json` before each run. Works when using `CURSOR_AGENT_NODE`/`CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT`, the versioned layout (`versions/YYYY.MM.DD-commit/`), or node.exe + index.js next to agent.cmd. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WIN_CMDLINE_MAX` | `30000` | (Windows) Upper bound (UTF-16 units, pessimistic) for the full `CreateProcess` command line. If the prompt would exceed it, the proxy keeps the tail of the prompt and prepends a short omission notice, logs a warning, and sets `X-Cursor-Proxy-Prompt-Truncated: true` on the response. Clamped to `4096`–`32700`. |
| `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIRS` | — | Comma-separated configuration directories for round-robin account rotation (alias: `CURSOR_ACCOUNT_DIRS`). Auto-discovers authenticated accounts under `~/.cursor-api-proxy/accounts/` when unset. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_MULTI_PORT` | `false` | When `true` and multiple config dirs are set, spawns a separate server per directory on incrementing ports starting from `CURSOR_BRIDGE_PORT`. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_PROMPT_VIA_STDIN` | `false` | When `true`, sends the user prompt via stdin instead of argv (helps on Windows if argv is truncated). |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_USE_ACP` | `false` | When `true`, uses ACP (Agent Client Protocol) over stdio (`agent acp`). Required for structured client-tool passthrough and avoids Windows argv limits. The installed agent must advertise HTTP MCP support. See [Cursor ACP docs](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/acp). Set `NODE_DEBUG=cursor-api-proxy:acp` to debug. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_ACP_SKIP_AUTHENTICATE` | auto | When `CURSOR_API_KEY` is set, skips the ACP authenticate step. Set to `true` to skip when using `agent login` instead. |
| `CURSOR_BRIDGE_ACP_RAW_DEBUG` | `false` | When `1` or `true`, log raw JSON-RPC from ACP stdout (requires `NODE_DEBUG=cursor-api-proxy:acp`). |
| `CURSOR_AGENT_BIN` | auto | Path to Cursor CLI binary. Explicit alias precedence: `CURSOR_AGENT_BIN`, then `CURSOR_CLI_BIN`, then `CURSOR_CLI_PATH`; otherwise prefer executable `cursor-agent` on `PATH`, then executable `agent`. |
| `CURSOR_AGENT_NODE` | — | (Windows) Path to Node.js. With `CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT`, spawns Node directly and bypasses cmd.exe's ~8191 limit (CreateProcess ~32K still applies; see `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WIN_CMDLINE_MAX`). |
| `CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT` | — | (Windows) Path to the agent script (e.g. `agent.cmd` or `.js`). Use with `CURSOR_AGENT_NODE` for long prompts. |

Notes:

- The `login` subcommand depends on `chrome-launcher`; its dependency tree may pull typings into production installs. Run `npm audit` before release; upstream may move types to `devDependencies` over time.
- `--tailscale` changes the default host to `0.0.0.0` only when `CURSOR_BRIDGE_HOST` is not already set.
- ACP `session/request_permission` uses `allow-once` only for the per-turn proxy-owned client-tool MCP invocation. Built-in and other tools use `reject-once`.
- Relative paths such as `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE`, `CURSOR_BRIDGE_SESSIONS_LOG`, `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_CERT`, and `CURSOR_BRIDGE_TLS_KEY` are resolved from the current working directory.

#### Windows command line limits

Two different limits matter:

1. cmd.exe, about 8191 characters. If the proxy invokes the agent through `cmd.exe`, long prompts can fail before the process starts.
2. CreateProcess, about 32,767 characters for the entire command line (executable path plus all arguments), even when spawning `node.exe` and the script directly.

When `agent.cmd` is used (e.g. under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cursor-agent\`), the proxy auto-detects the versioned layout (`versions/YYYY.MM.DD-commit/`) and spawns `node.exe` + `index.js` from the latest version directly, bypassing cmd.exe. If that does not apply, set both `CURSOR_AGENT_NODE` and `CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT` so the proxy spawns Node with the script and args without cmd.exe.

Very large prompts can still hit the CreateProcess cap and produce `spawn ENAMETOOLONG`. The proxy mitigates that on Windows by truncating the start of the prompt while keeping the tail (recent context), prepending a short notice, logging a warning, and optionally exposing `X-Cursor-Proxy-Prompt-Truncated: true`. Tune the budget with `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WIN_CMDLINE_MAX` (default `30000`). ACP or stdin prompt avoids argv length limits for prompt delivery.

Example (adjust paths to your install):

```bash
set CURSOR_AGENT_NODE=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
set CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT=C:\path\to\Cursor\resources\agent\agent.cmd
# or for cursor-agent versioned layout:
# set CURSOR_AGENT_NODE=%LOCALAPPDATA%\cursor-agent\versions\2026.03.11-6dfa30c\node.exe
# set CURSOR_AGENT_SCRIPT=%LOCALAPPDATA%\cursor-agent\versions\2026.03.11-6dfa30c\index.js
```

CLI flags:

| Flag           | Description                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--tailscale`  | Bind to `0.0.0.0` for access from tailnet/LAN (unless `CURSOR_BRIDGE_HOST` is already set) |
| `--verbose`    | Enable verbose logs (request/response previews + model resolution chain)                    |
| `--mode`       | Default Cursor CLI mode: `agent`, `ask`, or `plan` (default `ask` if omitted). Overridden by `CURSOR_BRIDGE_MODE` when set. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show CLI usage                                                                             |

Optional per-request overrides:

- Header `X-Cursor-Workspace: <path>`, subdirectory of `CURSOR_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE` when using a real workspace (see `CURSOR_BRIDGE_CHAT_ONLY_WORKSPACE`). In chat-only mode the agent cwd stays a temp dir; this value is still passed through as a short `X-Cursor-Workspace=` line in the preamble.
- Header `X-Cursor-Proxy-Client: <label>` (optional), shown as `client=` if `X-Cursor-Invoke-From` is not set.
- Header `X-Cursor-Invoke-From: <label>` (optional), preferred for `client=` (e.g. `claude-cli`, `cursor-claude-extension`).
- Header `X-Cursor-Mode: <agent|ask|plan>` or JSON body field `mode`, execution mode for that request (body wins over header).

CLI subcommands (see `cursor-api-proxy --help`): `login <name>`, `accounts` (list), `logout`, `usage`, `reset-hwid` (see `--help` for options). Flags above still apply to the server entrypoint.

## Multi-account setup

Use multiple Cursor accounts to spread load and stay under usage limits. The proxy includes a built-in account manager.

### Adding accounts

```bash
npx cursor-api-proxy login account1
```

Opens an isolated browser login. Session saves under `~/.cursor-api-proxy/accounts/` on macOS/Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor-api-proxy\accounts\` on Windows.

Repeat for more accounts:

```bash
npx cursor-api-proxy login account2
npx cursor-api-proxy login account3
```

When you start the proxy (`npx cursor-api-proxy`), it finds all accounts under that directory and adds them to the rotation pool.

### Manual config directories

If you already have separate configuration folders (or want to specify them explicitly), override auto-discovery with `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIRS`:

```bash
CURSOR_CONFIG_DIRS=/path/to/cursor-agent-1,/path/to/cursor-agent-2 npm start
```

### Modes of operation

Single port, round-robin rotation (default)

The proxy listens on one port and rotates through available accounts for each request, picking the least busy account. Active by default when multiple accounts are found.

Multi-port (one server per account)

For explicit client-to-account mapping, use multi-port mode. The proxy spawns multiple instances on incrementing ports starting from `CURSOR_BRIDGE_PORT`.

```bash
CURSOR_BRIDGE_MULTI_PORT=true CURSOR_BRIDGE_PORT=8765 npm start
```

account1 on 8765, account2 on 8766, and so on.

## Streaming

The proxy supports `stream: true` on `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/responses`, and `POST /v1/messages`. Chat Completions and Messages return Server-Sent Events (SSE) in OpenAI/Anthropic streaming formats. Responses uses OpenAI Responses semantic SSE events (`response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, …). Cursor CLI emits incremental deltas plus a final full message; the proxy deduplicates output so clients receive each chunk only once.

Test streaming from repo root, with the proxy running:

```bash
node examples/test-stream.mjs
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for details.

## Docker

Requires a Cursor Dashboard API key (`CURSOR_API_KEY` from https://cursor.com/dashboard/integrations).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set CURSOR_API_KEY=... in .env

docker compose up --build -d
```

Listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8765` by default (host bind via `HOST_BIND` / `HOST_PORT` in `.env`). Image installs the Cursor `agent` CLI and runs the proxy as a non-root user. Health probes hit `/healthz` (no API key required).

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/models
```
